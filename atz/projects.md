## Projects

### NASA RMC
I've done a lot of work for this project with UMN Robotics, including ROS autonomy stack setup, writing sensor nodes, and firm RT system control code.
See the [ROS code here](https://github.com/GOFIRST-Robotics/NASA-RMC-2020-NorthstarRobotics) and [STM32 code here.](https://github.com/GOFIRST-Robotics/NASA-RMC-2020-RT)

### "Puma" DC motor speed controller
A 200W DC H-bridge motor controller. Uses an ATTiny as the main controller. 
See the [AVR code here](https://github.com/juliaschatz/puma-attiny) and [EAGLE schematics and layout here.](https://github.com/juliaschatz/puma-eagle)

### Tower crane control systems research
I recently finished my undergrad thesis about a novel passivity-based control law for 3D tower cranes. You can read it [here.](/Julia_Schatz_Undergrad_Thesis.pdf)
