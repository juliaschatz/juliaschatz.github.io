## Projects

I spend a lot of my free time working on small robotics and electronics projects.
Some of my favorite are below.

### NASA RMC
I've done a lot of work for this project with UMN Robotics, including ROS autonomy stack setup, writing sensor nodes, and firm RT system control code.

### Differential Swerve
A fully omnidirectional differential swerve robot, designed, build, and programmed from the ground up. Still a work in progress.

### "Puma" Brushed Motor ESC
A 9V 20A full H-bridge DC motor speed controller. 
I designed this because I wasn't happy with low-budget high-hobby-power speed controllers.
