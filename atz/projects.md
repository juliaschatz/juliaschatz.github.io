## Projects

### Tower crane control systems research
My undergraduate thesis is about a novel passivity-based control law for 3D tower cranes. You can read it [here.](/Julia_Schatz_Undergrad_Thesis.pdf)

### NASA RMC
I've done a lot of work for this project with UMN Robotics, including ROS autonomy stack setup, writing sensor nodes, and firm RT system control code.
See the [ROS code here](https://github.com/GOFIRST-Robotics/NASA-RMC-2020-NorthstarRobotics) and [STM32 code here.](https://github.com/GOFIRST-Robotics/NASA-RMC-2020-RT)
